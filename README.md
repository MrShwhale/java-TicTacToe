# java-TicTacToe

This is a CLI implementation of Tic Tac Toe, with some added features. 

It has a perfect AI (although it is not ruthless - it doesn't prioritize higher chacne of winning), as well as 2 player mode.

Socket implementation was finished, but I lost the code...

I gave it a familiar personality, play along for some neat easter eggs!

To run this, simply download the .jar from releases and run it with the ```java``` command
